# ✈️ Closest Plane Finder

A Python tool that tracks live airplane data and identifies the two closest planes in the sky in real-time. Built using the [OpenSky Network API](https://opensky-network.org/), this script filters out irrelevant or stale data and performs 3D distance calculations using the Haversine formula with altitude.
